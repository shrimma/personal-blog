Welcome to the blog, where I'll be covering everything Azure, DevOps, dotnet, and VSTS.
<!--more-->

# Hello, and welcome!
First off thank you for finding the time to visit my blog, I know it's a crowded webspace out there. I've been developing software for around eight years, based in the sunny coastal climes of East England and I thought it was finally time to put some things down on paper - metaphorically of course, does anyone even use paper anymore?!

I'll be trying to cover technologies and topics that interest me specifically and hopefully some of them will also peak your attention. To start off I'll mostly be talking Azure and VSTS, as I'm working with them on a daily basis. But I also plan to post on devops methodology, docker, kubenetes, containerization, and the wider dotnet sphere.

I'm also toying with the idea of videos, perhaps short tutorial videos on various topics...but let's park that idea for another day.
